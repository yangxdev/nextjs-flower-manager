# üå∑ Flower Manager v1.1.0
### üë®üèª‚Äçüíª By Yang (@yangxdev)

### üå∏ Description
Welcome to my latest project! This is an order manager I made for my partner's flower business where she can keep track of her orders and customers throughout the month. This project gives me a chance to make a real world impact, using the latest technologies to make a product that can provide value to a business.
For the latest updates (also with explanatory GIFs) see my most recent [v1.1.0 release](https://github.com/yangxdev/nextjs-flower-manager/releases/tag/v1.1.0)!
